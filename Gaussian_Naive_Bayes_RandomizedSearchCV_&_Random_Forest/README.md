# Gaussian Naive Bayes, RandomizedSearchCV & Random Forest

Welcome to this repository, where I share a comprehensive Jupyter notebook designed to implement a machine learning pipeline for predicting stock performance using Gaussian Naive Bayes, RandomizedSearchCV, and Random Forest. 

I did not build the trading strategy in this document, but the predicted probabilities for deciles can be used to create signals and generate strategies. Further study can be seen in the Quantitative-Strategies repository.

## Introduction

In this study, I develop a customized loss function aimed at optimizing trading outcomes and train models tailored for long/short trading strategies. My goal is to provide a clear and practical example that highlights the potential of these methods.

## Methodology

- **Categorization of Returns**: Returns are categorized into 10 deciles based on individual stock performance. This method, influenced by the weak-form Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), should not generate great performance. In practice, we will include certain behavioral factors, macroeconomic factors, and more as input.
- **Cross-Sectional Return Deciles**: Practical applications often employ cross-sectional return deciles or rankings to extract nuanced information for trading. However, for demonstration and simplicity purposes, I have applied the example to a single stock.
- **Model Training**: The notebook includes training models using Gaussian Naive Bayes, RandomizedSearchCV, and Random Forest.

## Key Features

- **Technical Indicators**: Utilization of technical indicators to validate the model's ability to uncover valuable insights. For demonstration and simplicity purposes, I only apply several technical indicators. In practice, it's essential to include as many insightful features as possible, including macroeconomic indicators, microeconomic factors, company characteristics, text sentiment analysis, and behavioral data. Applying dimension reduction techniques is also crucial for managing the complexity of the data.

## Scope

This document focuses on the pipeline and procedures specifically for machine learning applications and does not contain detailed backtesting. Additionally, the features only include several technical indicators for illustration purposes.

## Conclusion

Through this study, I aim to demonstrate the transformative potential of advanced techniques in quantitative finance. I believe that with the right tools and approach, we can revolutionize trading strategies and achieve remarkable results.

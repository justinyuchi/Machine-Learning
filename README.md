# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains various machine learning and deep learning projects, with a particular focus on applications in Quantitative Finance. Additionally, some projects explore the methodology itself.

**Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am still in the process of uploading and organizing the projects. Please check back regularly for updates.

## Projects

### [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Stock Market](./PCA_on_Stock_Market)
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to stock market data. The analysis showcases how to leverage PCA to identify major risks and factors influencing asset returns, reconstruct component portfolios, and backtest the suggested portfolios. This study focuses on the first principal component, with similar procedures applicable to the second and third components.

## About Me

I am a Master's student in Quantitative Finance with dual bachelor's degrees in Science and Business Administration. My academic focus includes artificial intelligence, statistics, and finance. Most of the projects in this repository are related to the application of machine learning and deep learning in Quantitative Finance, although some are dedicated to exploring the methodologies themselves. Visit my [personal website](https://justinyuchi.github.io/justinyuchihsu.github.io/) for more about my work and interests.

# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains various machine learning and deep learning projects, with a particular focus on applications in Quantitative Finance. Additionally, some projects explore the methodology itself.

**Note:** This repository is currently a work in progress, and I am still in the process of uploading and organizing the projects. Please check back regularly for updates.

## About Me

I am a Master's student in Quantitative Finance with dual bachelor's degrees in Science and Business Administration. My academic focus includes artificial intelligence, statistics, and finance. Most of the projects in this repository are related to the application of machine learning and deep learning in Quantitative Finance, although some are dedicated to exploring the methodologies themselves.
